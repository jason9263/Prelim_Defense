Hi Junwei, 

Uber Green Card (GC) sponsorship can begin once you are in an eligible Uber sponsored non-immigrant status such as H-1B and once you have begun employment. Additionally, Uber's policy is to begin the green card process at an employee's 6 month mark with manager approval. To begin earlier requires director-level approval. Once either of the above is met, you can kick-off the process by completing Uber's green card initiation questionnaire. 

Due to the high level of scrutiny for the EB-1 category, we recommend demonstrating significant contributions for 3 or more of the criteria below.
