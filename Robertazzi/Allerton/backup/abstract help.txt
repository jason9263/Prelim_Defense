The call for papers (please check) says the extended abstract is 5 to 10 pages including references - and the published paper is 8 pages.  

I will try writing some text on the background of the paper (networks on chips and div load theory) and you can create some text on the technical content of the paper.  Write only on what will be in the paper - do not talk about the entire thesis.  If you have questions email me or contact me by phone 631 281  9331 at home.
